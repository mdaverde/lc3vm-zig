# LC3vm-zig

Written entirely in Zig, this project implements a virtual machine for LC-3 programs.

Note: because Zig isn't stable yet and this project was based off a source code build off master (version below), this might be broken against your version of Zig. I'll be using this project as an excuse to keep up to date with the language so hopefully fixes will be merged when I get to it.

## About LC-3

 > Little Computer 3, or LC-3, is a type of computer educational programming language, an assembly language, which is a type of low-level programming language. The LC-3 was developed by Yale N. Patt at the University of Texas at Austin and Sanjay J. Patel at the University of Illinois at Urbanaâ€“Champaign. Their specification of the instruction set, the overall architecture of the LC-3, and a hardware implementation can be found in their textbook "Introduction to Computing Systems."

## Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)

The specification for the ISA can be found [here](https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/supplies/lc3-isa.pdf)

## Usage

### Dependencies

Development was done using the, at the time, latest master branch of [Zig](https://github.com/ziglang/zig) on a Linux x86_64 machine.

```shell
$ zig version
0.9.0-dev.952+0c091feb5
```

### Build

```shell
$ zig build
$ ./zig-out/bin/lc3vm imagefile.obj
```

### Running from source

```
$ zig run ./src/main.zig -- imagefile.obj
```

### Testing

```shell
$ zig test ./test.zig
All tests passed.
```

## Could be cool to add

Full blown simulation debugging tools might be too much but could also be kinda fun

Windows support and macOS testing
