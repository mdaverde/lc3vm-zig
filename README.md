# LC3vm-zig

Written entirely in Zig, this project implements a virtual machine for LC-3 programs, an educational ISA.

## About LC-3

 > Little Computer 3, or LC-3, is a type of computer educational programming language, an assembly language, which is a type of low-level programming language. The LC-3 was developed by Yale N. Patt at the University of Texas at Austin and Sanjay J. Patel at the University of Illinois at Urbanaâ€“Champaign. Their specification of the instruction set, the overall architecture of the LC-3, and a hardware implementation can be found in their textbook "Introduction to Computing Systems."

## Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)

The specification for the ISA can be found [here](https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/supplies/lc3-isa.pdf)

## Usage

### Dependencies

Development was done using the, at the time, latest master branch of [Zig](https://github.com/ziglang/zig) on a Linux x86_64 machine.

```shell
$ zig version
0.9.0-dev.952+0c091feb5
```

### Build

```shell
$ zig build
```

### Testing

```shell
$ zig test ./test.zig
All tests passed.
```
